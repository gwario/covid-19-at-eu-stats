# Brainstorming for research questions around SARS-CoV-2

## Stability

### Light resistance

How does light with different wave length and intensities affect stability in a normal home environment
How can short high intensity light flashes kill the virus

### On surfaces

How long can the virus survive on bread?
How long can the virus survive on vegetables?
How long can the virus survive on fabrics?

## Spreading

### Aerosole spreading

How does wind intensity on different contaminated surfaces affect the virus concentration on those surfaces, i.e. can you blow it off or better.
How much of the virus cells on the floor can be spread into the air when e.g. a vacuum is used to clean the floor. Addition: how endangered is cleaning personnel?
